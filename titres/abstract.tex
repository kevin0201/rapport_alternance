This report aim to present all the missions i accomplished during my intern in Groupama Gan Vie with python as my main tool. It shows how python is a very useful and powerful programming language. Python is not a simple programming language, python is a whole set of tools in itself. Python can do data analysis, manipulation, and machine learning. I also participate in the elaboration of a anomaly detection model for the assets and liabilities management practice. This model is essentially to make data reliable.
